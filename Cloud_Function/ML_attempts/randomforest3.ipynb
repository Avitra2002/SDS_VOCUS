Marcus had been my contact point throughout because my family only bank with DBS. Despite the requests are not within the scope of his job but Marcus over extended his helping hands to the very best of his abilities. Giving advice and direct me to other services like home loan department. Over the years he gained my trust and friendship. I feel that he has my interest at heart, for which I am very grateful.\n",
