Youâ€™ll first find yourself in the dashboard page where you can see an overview of the analytics and actionables according to your chosen date, products and sources. A new speech bubble feature shows more information and instructions on the analytics that you hover over.

The first analytics that you see will be the Overall Sentiment Score that displays the average sentiment score with a rating out of 5. Next will be the distribution of sentiments where the analytics is categorised into Frustrated, Unsatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied and Promote. To the right would be a tracker of the current InProgress and Done actions. Clicking on this widget would lead you to the actionables page. More on that in a bit.

In the second row, you will see the Sentiment Trend for the products selected across all the subcategories that the product has to offer. It displays the trend of average VOCUS sentiment score per day and you can hover over the graph to see a specific date and score.

At the bottom, the circular graph represents the distribution of categories according to frequency. The most inner circle shows the products chosen which in this case are digital channels and contact center. The 2nd inner circle would show all the subcategories for each of the products. For example, the product digital channels has 2 subcategories: PayLah and Digibank App. Finally the outer circle shows the feedback category for all products.
Below the circle graph shows the top 3 most occuring feedbacks across all products chosen.

On the right, we can see the top 5 positive and negative subcategories according to sentiments across all products chosen. The vertical axis of the graph shows the subcategories followed by the feedback category. For example in the top 5 positive categories, we have DBS Branches/Staff as the subcategory and Process Related as the feedback category.

At the top right corner of the dashboard page, there is a generate report button that allows you to download a PDF featuring all the statistics on the dashboard page.

Next we have the Analytics Page, where it displays the sentiment trend for one selected subcategory and multiple feedback categories. You can hover over the point on the graph to see the specific date and score.

At the bottom we have the sentiments categorised by chosen subcategory. The vertical axes represents the feedback category and you can click view all to see more feedback categories. There is also a sort button to sort the sentiments by the most positive or negative. Clicking on the bars would lead to a pop up that shows the specific data that contributes to this sentiment

Next, we have the Actionables Page, where the AI model will generate a to-do lists of actions based on date, product, and source of the VOCUS. The feedback is split into 3 columns that shows the status of the actionables-- Generated Actions in red, In Progress in orange, and Done in green. The newly generated actions would be displayed under the first column and the actionables are further categorised into 4 categories -- To Fix, To Keep In Mind, To Promote and To Amplify. For each action, there is a view data button that leads to a popup featuring the VOCUS that contributes to the action. Do remember to change the status of the generated action to In Progress or Done.

The change of status will be reflected and you can also delete any action of your choice.

For any products and sources that do not have data for the chosen date, there will be a popup that would let the user know.

You can also customise your list and add your own action and the action will automatically be assigned to In Progress status. Enter your action and choose a subcategory and various feedback categories that links to the action. Lastly, please choose an actionable category and you're all set!

Last but not least, we have the upload page. Choose a subcategory and source before adding in your new data.
