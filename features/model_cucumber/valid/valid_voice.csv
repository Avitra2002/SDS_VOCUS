3/3/24,VTM-CCTR,Complaint,Staff Knowledge/Competency,"I was trying to help my domestic helper activate her multi-currency DBS visa debit card. I was at the VTM at ARC (Labrador) at 5.55pm. Was told by the officer on video chat to exit and try again. I did that but I couldn't reconnect to the officer. Was told that no officer was available. It appeared to be a feeble attempt by your officer to dismiss serving me at the end of the day, knowing that there was no recourse for me to reconnect to him. You could review the CCTV recordings and advise why that unprofessional service given. I now have to find time to go back to the VTM with my domestic helper to update her mobile phone number for future OTPs as well as her email address. This could have been avoided and really unnecessary had your officer just guided me through the process.",Negative,VTM,Staff Related
